####Java:
Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and high-level computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology. Our testing automation frameworks are written in core Java.

####Maven:
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information. Maven is a Java tool, so you must have Java installed in order to proceed.

Maven allows a project to build using its project object model (POM) and a set of plugins that are shared by all projects using Maven, providing a uniform build system. Maven is also used as a dependency management tool. Once the dependencies are added to the pom.xml file, Maven automatically downloads all the JAR files and helps to build the project.

####TestNG:
TestNG is a testing framework designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs. TestNG was inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

* Annotations.
* Test that your code is multithread safe.
* Flexible test configuration.
* Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
* Support for parameters.
* Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...).

####Selenium WebDriver:
WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows to spin up browsers and do certain user actions (click, enter text, refresh, navigate, etc.) in an automated manner. WebDriver also allows using a programming language to create test scripts. WebDriver interacts with page elements in a realistic way. For example, if the webpage has a disabled text box, WebDriver will not be able to enter any value in it just as how a real person cannot.
